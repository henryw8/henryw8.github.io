                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>I’m passionate about using data and technology to make sports more transparent while gaining a competitive edge. Growing up as a mathlete, competitive swimmer, and an avid Philadelphia sports fan, I’ve always appreciated the harmony between the game and the numbers we use to describe it.</p>
                <p>Today, I split my time between MIT’s Sports Lab, where I’m working with FIFA to build systems that assist referees on the pitch, and the Boston Red Sox, where I focus on extracting hitting and pitcing insights from our motion-capture data.</p>

                                <p>At the MIT Sports Lab, I'm working on making advanced sports technology more accessible and fair. My primary project involves developing automated systems to help referees make better decisions in soccer, using optical tracking data to detect last touches and classify fouls.</p>
                                <p>I also research how analytics adoption impacts team performance in professional sports. One recent project used causal inference methods to show that NBA teams significantly undervalue their analytics departments compared to players—a finding published in the Journal of Sports Economics.</p>
                                <p>As the lab's liaison to FIFA, I present our research at international conferences and help bridge the gap between academic innovation and practical implementation for FIFA's 211 member associations.</p>

                            <p>Using causal inference methods, I found that NBA teams significantly undervalue their analytics departments compared to players. The research shows that adding an analyst has a comparable impact on wins as many mid-tier players, but at a fraction of the cost.</p>
